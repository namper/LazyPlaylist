# LazyPlaylist
This will be clustering algorithm which will try to learn
playlists depending on user listening history

### LazyPlaylist v1
trying to build space using probability vectors
depended on listening sequence, for example:
user is most likely to play 
        
        pink floyd -> led zeppelin  
        
rather then

        kate pery -> led zeppelin
